abstract = {The remote-sensing reflectance Rrs is notdirectly measurable, and various methodologies have been employed inits estimation. I review the radiative transfer foundations ofseveral commonly used methods for estimatingRrs, and errors associated with estimatingRrs by removal of surface-reflected sky radianceare evaluated using the Hydrolight radiative transfer numericalmodel. The dependence of the sea surface reflectance factor $\rho$,which is not an inherent optical property of the surface, on skyconditions, wind speed, solar zenith angle, and viewing geometry isexamined. If $\rho$ is not estimated accurately, significant errorscan occur in the estimated Rrs for near-zenithSun positions and for high wind speeds, both of which can giveconsiderable Sun glitter effects. The numerical simulations suggestthat a viewing direction of 40 deg from the nadir and 135 deg from theSun is a reasonable compromise among conflicting requirements. Forthis viewing direction, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is acceptableonly for wind speeds less than 5 m s-1. Forhigher wind speeds, curves are presented for the determination of $\rho$as a function of solar zenith angle and wind speed. If the sky isovercast, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is used at all windspeeds.},
