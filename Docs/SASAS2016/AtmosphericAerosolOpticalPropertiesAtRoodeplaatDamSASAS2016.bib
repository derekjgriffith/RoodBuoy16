  Abstract                 = {The MODTRANTM5 radiation transport (RT) model is a major advancement over earlier versions of the MODTRANTM atmospheric transmittance and radiance model. New model features include (1) finer spectral resolution via the Spectrally Enhanced Resolution MODTRAN (SERTRAN) molecular band model, (2) a fully coupled treatment of auxiliary molecular species, and (3) a rapid, high fidelity multiple scattering (MS) option. The finer spectral resolution improves model accuracy especially in the mid- and long-wave infrared atmospheric windows; the auxiliary species option permits the addition of any or all of the suite of HITRAN molecular line species, along with default and user-defined profile specification; and the MS option makes feasible the calculation of Vis-NIR databases that include high-fidelity scattered radiances.},

  Abstract                 = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is the European programme to establish a European capacity for Earth Observation. \{GMES\} is designed to provide European policy makers and public authorities with accurate and timely information to better manage the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite mission specifically designed for \{GMES\} to ensure the long-term collection and operational delivery of high-quality measurements to \{GMES\} ocean, land, and atmospheric services, while contributing to the GMES, emergency and security services. Key Sentinel-3 measurement requirements, corresponding to identified \{GMES\} user needs, have been derived as follows:• Sea surface topography (SSH), significant wave height (Hs) and surface wind speed derived over the global ocean to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by \{ENVISAT\} Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2) but with enhanced surface topography measurements in the coastal zone, sea ice regions and over inland rivers, their tributaries and lakes. • Sea surface temperature (SST) determined for oceanic and coastal waters globally to an equivalent accuracy and precision as that presently achieved by the \{ENVISAT\} Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) over the ocean (i.e. &lt; 0.3 K), at a spatial resolution of 1 km. • Visible, and Short-Wave Infrared radiances for oceanic, inland and coastal waters at a spatial resolution of 0.3 km (simultaneously and co-registered with \{SST\} measurements), determined to an equivalent level of accuracy and precision as \{ENVISAT\} Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer with complete ocean coverage in 2–3 days. • Visible and infrared radiances over global land-surfaces in 1–2 days, sea-ice and ice-sheets equivalent to those currently provided from \{ENVISAT\} MERIS, \{AATSR\} and Système Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation. The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating:• A dual frequency, Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, a Precise Orbit Determination package including a \{GPS\} receiver, a \{DORIS\} instrument and a laser retro-reflector. • A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multi-channel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces. • A dual-view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) delivering accurate surface ocean, land, and ice temperature. • A collaborative ground segment providing management of the mission, management, development, production and access to core data products in an operational near real time delivery context. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having 7-year lifetime, over a 20-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-3A in late 2013 and of Sentinel-3B in late 2014. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180°. This paper provides an overview of the \{GMES\} Sentinel-3 mission including the mission background and user requirements, a technical description of the space segment, a brief overview of the ground segment concept, and a summary description of Sentinel-3 data products and their anticipated performance. },

  Abstract                 = { The socio-economic well-being of South Africa is largely dependent on reservoir lakes. Contrastingly, the country lacks reservoir management skills and training, with a generation having passed since there was limited activity in this field. This review introduces two new, independent analyses which, using in-lake total phosphorus or satellite-measured chlorophyll-a, respectively, reveal that between 41\% and 76\% of total storage is eutrophic or hypertrophic. This is in stark contrast to a claimed 5\% made by the responsible government agency (Department of Water and Sanitation). Data and information on the incidence and toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms are sparse, yet severe problems exist. There is a concentration of focus on water quantity, with absent parallel consideration of the additional limitations posed by poor water quality. The most seriously impacted reservoirs are located in the economic heartland of South Africa, which has an extant regional water quality crisis. The reasons behind the startling lack of attention to reservoir limnology, despite clear and long-standing warnings, are examined and placed in the perspective of an acknowledged and impending water crisis. It will take considerable time to up-skill South African limnologists to meet the needs highlighted by worsening reservoir water quality, and to offset the social and economic impacts that will transpire, if not timeously ameliorated. The responsible agency urgently needs to establish a reservoir-management programme that embraces remaining individual and institutional memory, integrates all available relevant knowledge and scientific findings, prioritises needs and acquires those skills and resources necessary to meet what is likely to become a crippling legacy of inaction. },

  Abstract                 = {The concept and description of a remote sensing aerosol monitoring network initiated by NASA, developed to support NASA, CNES, and NASDA’s Earth satellite systems under the name \{AERONET\} and expanded by national and international collaboration, is described. Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites \{GOES\} and METEOSATS’ Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75% of the Earth’s surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90% in 1998. \{NASA\} developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The system’s automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals. This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system, the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description of the processing system, and access to the database. },

This means that the derived water-leaving radiance (or remote-sensing reflectance) can be highly inaccurate if a spectrally constant $\rho$ value is applied (although errors can be reduced by carefully filtering measured raw data). To remove surface-reflected light in field measurements of remote sensing reflectance, a spectral optimization approach was applied, with results compared with those from remote-sensing models and from direct measurements. The agreement from different determinations suggests that reasonable results for remote sensing reflectance of clear blue water to turbid brown water are obtainable from above-surface measurements, even under conditions of high waves.},

  Abstract                 = { The empirical approach of remote sensing has a proven capability to provide timely and accurate information on inland and near-coastal transitional waters. This article gives a thorough review of empirical algorithms for quantitatively estimating a variety of parameters from space-borne, airborne and in situ remote sensors in inland and transitional waters, including chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, Secchi disk depth (z SD), turbidity, absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (a CDOM) and other parameters, for example, phycocyanin. Current remote-sensing instruments are also reviewed. The theoretical basis of the empirical algorithms is given using fundamental bio-optical theory of the inherent optical properties (IOPs). Bands, band ratios and band arithmetic algorithms that could be used to produce common biogeophysical products for inland/transitional waters are identified. The article discusses the potential role that empirical algorithms could play alongside more advanced model-based algorithms in the future of water remote sensing, especially for near real-time operational monitoring systems. The article aims to describe the current status of empirical remote sensing in inland and near-coastal transitional waters and provide a useful reference to workers. It does not cover ‘inversion’ algorithms. },

If $\rho$ is not estimated accurately, significant errorscan occur in the estimated Rrs for near-zenithSun positions and for high wind speeds, both of which can giveconsiderable Sun glitter effects. The numerical simulations suggestthat a viewing direction of 40 deg from the nadir and 135 deg from theSun is a reasonable compromise among conflicting requirements. Forthis viewing direction, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is acceptableonly for wind speeds less than 5 m s-1. Forhigher wind speeds, curves are presented for the determination of $\rho$as a function of solar zenith angle and wind speed.
