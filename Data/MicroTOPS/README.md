# MicroTOPS Data
We (CSIR) have two MicroTOPS II portable handheld sunphotometers. These have been used for aerosol optical thickness and water vapour column measurements at Roodeplaat and on many other campaigns. 

Raw downloads of MicroTOPS data may have the .log extension, where the date is that of download - generally including all data measured by the instrument prior to that date.
Raw downloads can also include calibration coefficiencts, useful for tracking the instrument calibrations. Both instruments have old (expired) calibration data. Therefore they have been 
compared to one another and to the AERONET Cimel CE318 at CSIR. Comparison data hopefully also appears in this folder.
