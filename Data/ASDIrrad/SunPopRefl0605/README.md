# Diffuse/Global Horizontal Irradiance Ratio
The purpose of this experiment was to measure the diffuse component of horizontal spectral irradiance as a fraction of the total horizontal spectral irradiance.

The experiment was conducted using a pole having an obscuration on the end ("lollipop") to obscure the direct component of solar irradiance. The reference measurement (white reference in ASD terminology) is taken with the lollipop just out of the way (not obscuring the sensor head) and the "reflectance" measurement with the lollipop shadow falling on the head.

The diffuse/global ratio is quite strongly dependent on aerosol optical thickness and other optical properties and can be used to verify the accuracy of the aerosol model selected or compiled in MODTRAN when extrapolating radiance to TOA.
