# ASD Spectral Irradiance Data
Most of the data here is spectral irradiance data collected at Roodeplaat dam on the shoreline wesst of the dam wall. ASD spectral irradiance data was collected using a Remote Cosine Receptor (RSR) attachment. The ASD (now PANAlytical) model is the FieldSpec 3.

White reference comparison data was collected using an ASD contact probe. Multiple white references were measured relative to the white reference in the cap of the contact probe. Also measured were a number of surrogate reflectance panels painted with matte blue-biased grey paint as well as a metal panel covered with a matte white PVA plastic film. These panels were about 40 cm by 30 cm in size. The main concern when using such surrogates for real measurements is the BRDF effects which are much larger than those on spectralon panels, as well as a typical blue cutoff in reflectance often resulting from the use of titanium dioxide as a white pigment. 

Data in the "sunpop" directories is collected using a "lollipop" to obscure the direct component of the solar irradiance. This is not so much to measure the absolute difference between the direct and diffuse components as to obtain the diffuse to global spectral irradiance ratio. This ratio can be helful in validating the aerosol model used in the radiative transfer computational work. Diffuse to global ratios can be measured in the reflectance mode of the ASD, by taking a white reference with the lollipop head just below the position in which it obscures the RCR and the measureing reflectance with the lollipop obscuring the direct sun component on the RCR.
