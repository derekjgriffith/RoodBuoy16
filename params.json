Measurements of remote sensing reflectance at 4 points on Roodeplaat Dam using an ASD spectroradiometer, above water from a boat on 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06.\r\n2. Measurements of downwelling spectral irradiance using an ASD and a BWTek spectrometer on the shoreline on 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06.\r\n3. Measurmments of aerosol optical depth/thickness (AOD/AOT) using a pair of MicroTOPS II sunphotometers. Shoreline and on the boat, 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06. \r\n3. Mooring of a buoy for multiple in-situ measurements on 2016-06-07. The duration of the mooring could be several weeks to months.\r\n4. Radiative transfer using in-situ measurements to estimate TOA radiances for Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 on 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06.\r\n\r\nSee the blog postings at http://cyanolakes.com/validation-roodeplaat-dam/ and http://cyanolakes.com/sentinel-3-validation/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
