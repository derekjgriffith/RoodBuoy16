[Cluster]
# The profile is the ipyparallel security profile
# The profile is defined by a .json file that is
# created when the ipyparallel hub/controller is started.
# The profile is generally stored in ~/.ipython/profile_??????/security
# where ?????? is the profile name.
# This profile file is generated by the hub/controller process when started using 
# the ipcluster or ipcontroller command and it may need to be copied from 
# the host running the hub/controller to the machine running the client.
#
# When the ipcontroller is restarted, it helps to use ipcontroller --reuse 
# to avoid overwriting the .json files and the requirement to copy the 
# new .json files to the compute client machine(s).
#
# See the ipyparallel documentation for further details.
