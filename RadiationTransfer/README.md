# Atmospheric Radiative Transfer
This folder contains scripts and data for atmospheric radiative transfer calculations related to the Roodeplaat/Sentinel campaign 2016.

Both MODTRAN and libRadtran have been used for this work. In order to use the MODTRAN scripts here, a copy of MODTRAN 5 will be required. See http://www.modtran5.com

For Matlab scripts which use MODTRAN, the Matlab/MODTRAN wrapper is also required, which can be found at https://github.com/derekjgriffith/matlab-modtran-5

libRadtran can be obtained from http://www.libradtran.org

For Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks which use libRadtran, the Python MORTICIA package is required, which can be obtained at https://github.com/derekjgriffith/MORTICIA
