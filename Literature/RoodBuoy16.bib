  Abstract                 = {Results are summarized for a scientific project devoted to the comparison of four atmospheric radiative transfer codes incorporated into different satellite data processing algorithms, namely, 6SV1.1 (second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum, vector, version 1.1), RT3 (radiative transfer), MODTRAN (moderate resolution atmospheric transmittance and radiance code), and SHARM (spherical harmonics). The performance of the codes is tested against well-known benchmarks, such as Coulson's tabulated values and a Monte Carlo code. The influence of revealed differences on aerosol optical thickness and surface reflectance retrieval is estimated theoretically by using a simple mathematical approach. All information about the project can be found at http://rtcodes.ltdri.org.},

  Abstract                 = {Using hyperspectral measurements made in the field, we show that the effective sea-surface reflectance $\rho$ (defined as the ratio of the surface-reflected radiance at the specular direction corresponding to the downwelling sky radiance from one direction) varies not only for different measurement scans, but also can differ by a factor of 8 between 400 nm and 800 nm for the same scan. This means that the derived water-leaving radiance (or remote-sensing reflectance) can be highly inaccurate if a spectrally constant $\rho$ value is applied (although errors can be reduced by carefully filtering measured raw data). To remove surface-reflected light in field measurements of remote sensing reflectance, a spectral optimization approach was applied, with results compared with those from remote-sensing models and from direct measurements. The agreement from different determinations suggests that reasonable results for remote sensing reflectance of clear blue water to turbid brown water are obtainable from above-surface measurements, even under conditions of high waves.},

  Abstract                 = {Generation of random sea surfaces using wave variance spectra and Fourier transforms is formulated in a way that guarantees conservation of wave energy and fully resolves wave height and slope variances. Monte Carlo polarized ray tracing, which accounts for multiple scattering between light rays and wave facets, is used to compute effective Mueller matrices for reflection and transmission of air- or water-incident polarized radiance. Irradiance reflectances computed using a Rayleigh sky radiance distribution, sea surfaces generated with Cox--Munk statistics, and unpolarized ray tracing differ by 10\%--18\% compared with values computed using elevation- and slope-resolving surfaces and polarized ray tracing. Radiance reflectance factors, as used to estimate water-leaving radiance from measured upwelling and sky radiances, are shown to depend on sky polarization, and improved values are given.},

  Abstract                 = {The remote-sensing reflectance Rrs is notdirectly measurable, and various methodologies have been employed inits estimation. I review the radiative transfer foundations ofseveral commonly used methods for estimatingRrs, and errors associated with estimatingRrs by removal of surface-reflected sky radianceare evaluated using the Hydrolight radiative transfer numericalmodel. The dependence of the sea surface reflectance factor $\rho$,which is not an inherent optical property of the surface, on skyconditions, wind speed, solar zenith angle, and viewing geometry isexamined. If $\rho$ is not estimated accurately, significant errorscan occur in the estimated Rrs for near-zenithSun positions and for high wind speeds, both of which can giveconsiderable Sun glitter effects. The numerical simulations suggestthat a viewing direction of 40 deg from the nadir and 135 deg from theSun is a reasonable compromise among conflicting requirements. Forthis viewing direction, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is acceptableonly for wind speeds less than 5 m s-1. Forhigher wind speeds, curves are presented for the determination of $\rho$as a function of solar zenith angle and wind speed. If the sky isovercast, a value of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.028 is used at all windspeeds.},
