# Roodeplaat Dam Campaign for Sentinel Satellites in 2016
A repository of documents, data and related processing code for the Roodeplaat Dam campaign for the ESA Sentinel satellites (Sentinel 2 and 3).

Roodeplaat Dam, a water reservoir and recreation area, is located near Pretoria, South Africa.

Campaign activities, particularly those related to the Sentinel 2 and 3 satellites included the following.

1. Measurements of remote sensing reflectance at 4 points on Roodeplaat Dam using an ASD spectroradiometer, above water from a boat on 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06.
2. Measurements of downwelling spectral irradiance using an ASD and a BWTek spectrometer on the shoreline on 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06.
3. Measurmments of aerosol optical depth/thickness (AOD/AOT) using a pair of MicroTOPS II sunphotometers. Shoreline and on the boat, 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06. 
3. Mooring of a buoy for multiple in-situ measurements on 2016-06-07. The duration of the mooring could be several weeks to months.
4. Radiative transfer using in-situ measurements to estimate TOA radiances for Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 on 2016-06-05 and 2016-06-06.
